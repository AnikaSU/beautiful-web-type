# Changelog

## 2018 Nov 26
* **Updated [Alegreya](https://beautifulwebtype.com/alegreya/) to v2.008**

## 2018 Nov 25
* **Improved the design of several samples**
* **Added [Le Murmure](https://beautifulwebtype.com/le-murmure/)**
* **Removed Colus**. After adding this typeface earlier in the week, I discovered that it was free but not open-source. After some thought Iâ€™ve decided to focus exclusively on open-source, rather than just free, typefaces.

## 2018 Nov 20
* **Added [Poppins](https://beautifulwebtype.com/poppins/)**
* **Added [Colus](https://beautifulwebtype.com/colus/)**
* **Updated home page to show only 10 latest typefaces as well as pairings**. Given the number of typefaces now on the site, showing them all was causing the home page to load too slowly.

## 2018 Nov 19
* **Improved layout and design for tablets**

## 2018 Nov 09
* **Added first group of [recommended typeface pairings](https://beautifulwebtype.com/pairings/)**. Each pairing example is also available from the detail pages of the respective typefaces.

## 2018 Nov 06
* **Added short description for each typeface**

## 2018 Nov 04
* **Added a P2P mirror via the Dat protocol at [dat://beautifulwebtype.com/](dat://beautifulwebtype.com/).** You can access the distributed version using [Beaker Browser](https://beakerbrowser.com).
* **Updated the sample for [IBM Plex Mono](https://beautifulwebtype.com/ibm-plex-mono/)**

* **Added [IBM Plex Serif](https://beautifulwebtype.com/ibm-plex-serif/)**

## 2018 Oct 28
* **Added [BioRhyme Expanded](https://beautifulwebtype.com/biorhyme-expanded/)**

## 2018 Oct 25
* **Preload some fonts to improve rendering on page load**. It's going to be a constant challenge with page load times and font rendering, given the number of assets I'm loading. As a first step, I'm preloading fonts that appear in the site header and index page headers.

## 2018 Oct 23
* **Added [FiraGo](https://beautifulwebtype.com/firago/)**

## 2018 Oct 22
* **Added [Rakkas](https://beautifulwebtype.com/rakkas/)**

## 2018 Oct 19
* **Added [Archivo Black](https://beautifulwebtype.com/archivo-black/)**
* **Updated the visual design of all typeface samples**. My original intention was to keep all the samples black and white in order to focus attention on the typeface rather than the design. However, I came to feel that the black backgrounds when viewed together became too monotonous. Additionally, the color helps to suggest a usage context for each typeface.
* **Removed Merriweather**. I could no longer ignore the feeling that Merriweather was not a top-quality open-source typeface. It's missing ligatures and other OpenType features and aesthetically I feel it has flaws.

## 2018 Oct 15
* Completely new version of site with new typefaces, updated examples, and new detail pages showing OpenType features and more.
