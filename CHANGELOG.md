## 2018 Oct 25
* **Preload some fonts to improve rendering on page load**. It's going to be a constant challenge with page load times and font rendering, given the number of assets I'm loading. As a first step, I'm preloading fonts that appear in the site header and index page headers.

## 2018 Oct 23
* **Add [FiraGo](https://beautifulwebtype.com/firago/)**

## 2018 Oct 22
* **Add [Rakkas](https://beautifulwebtype.com/rakkas/)**

## 2018 Oct 19
* **Add [Archivo Black](https://beautifulwebtype.com/archivo-black/)**
* **Update the visual design of all typeface samples**. My original intention was to keep all the samples black and white in order to focus attention on the typeface rather than the design. However, I came to feel that the black backgrounds when viewed together became too monotonous. Additionally, the color helps to suggest a usage context for each typeface.
* **Remove Merriweather**. I could no longer ignore the feeling that Merriweather was not a top-quality open-source typeface. It's missing ligatures and other OpenType features and aesthetically I feel it has flaws.

## 2018 Oct 15
* Completely new version of site with new typefaces, updated examples, and new detail pages showing OpenType features and more.
