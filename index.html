      <h1>Albert Camus</h1>
      <p>There is grim philosophical irony in the fact that Albert Camus should have died in a senseless automobile accident, victim of a chance mishap. For the central theme of his thought was the proper response of the thinking man to the plight that is posed by the gift of life.</p>
      <p>It is only superficially that Camus&rsquo; philosophy seemed to some readers to be a doctrine of pessimism and despair. Rather it is a creed which calls on men for the most heroic kind of affirmation of life. Comparing mankind&rsquo;s destiny to that of Sisyphus, who must endlessly roll the stone toward the mountain top, knowing full well that it will roll back before the goal is reached so that it must be pushed up again in an endless cycle of toil, Camus nevertheless rejected the alternatives either of physical suicide or of what he regarded as philosophic suicide, that is, the consolation to be found in illusion.</p>

      <p>It had taken long for her to come to that question, and there was light piercing into the room. She opened her curtains, and looked out towards the bit of road that lay in view, with fields beyond outside the entrance-gates. On the road there was a man with a bundle on his back and a woman carrying her baby; in the field she could see figures movingâ€”perhaps the shepherd with his dog. Far off in the bending sky was the pearly light; and she felt the largeness of the world and the manifold wakings of men to labor and endurance. She was a part of that involuntary, palpitating life, and could neither look out on it from her luxurious shelter as a mere spectator, nor hide her eyes in selfish complaining.</p>

      <h1>De Beneficiis</h1>
      <hr>
      <h2>Book I.</h2>
      <p>Among the numerous faults of those who pass their lives recklessly and without due reflexion, my good friend Liberalis, I should say that there is hardly any one so hurtful to society as this, that we neither know how to bestow or how to receive a benefit. It follows from this that benefits are badly invested, and become bad debts: in these cases it is too late to complain of their not being returned, for they were thrown away when we bestowed them. Nor need we wonder that while the greatest vices are common, none is more common than ingratitude: for this I see is brought about by various causes. The first of these is, that we do not choose worthy persons upon whom to bestow our bounty, but although when we are about to lend money we first make a careful enquiry into the means and habits of life of our debtor, and avoid sowing seed in a worn-out or unfruitful soil, yet without any discrimination we scatter our benefits at random rather than bestow them. It is hard to say whether it is more dishonourable for the receiver to disown a benefit, or for the giver to demand a return of it: for a benefit is a loan, the repayment of which depends merely upon the good feeling of the debtor. To misuse a benefit like a spendthrift is most shameful, because we do not need our wealth but only our intention to set us free from the obligation of it; for a benefit is repaid by being acknowledged. Yet while they are to blame who do not even show so much gratitude as to acknowledge their debt, we ourselves are to blame no less. We find many men ungrateful, yet we make more men so, because at one time we harshly and reproachfully demand some return for our bounty, at another we are fickle and regret what we have given, at another we are peevish and apt to find fault with trifles. By acting thus we destroy all sense of gratitude, not only after we have given anything, but while we are in the act of giving it.</p>
