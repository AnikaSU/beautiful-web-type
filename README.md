# Beautiful web type: https://beautifulwebtype.com

In October 2018 I released a completely re-thought and re-designed version of this project. The first version (and many subsequent projects following in its footsteps) put an emphasis on stylized examples of the typeface in use. This often served to hide the flaws and limitations of the various typefaces.

In contrast, the new version of the site aims to provide a complete look at each typeface, cataloging all the available weights and styles, the kerning quality, OpenType features, special characters and more.

I have spent a great deal of time sorting through the growing number of open-source typefaces. I will highlight only those that show a high level of quality, with a preference to typefaces that are still under active development.

I plan on growing this site to be the definitive resource for open-source typefaces. I will be adding new typefaces and site features continuously. Please consider supporting the project through a donation.

## Suggesting Typefaces

I'm happy to receive suggestions for typefaces to feature either though [a GitHub issue](https://github.com/ubuwaits/beautiful-web-type/issues) or via [email](mailto:ubuwaits@gmail.com). When sending the suggestion please send an example or two of the type somewhere in use. This helps me to make an initial evaluation of the typeface.
