# [Beautiful web type](https://beautifulwebtype.com)

In October 2018 I released a completely re-thought and re-designed version of Beautiful Web Type. The first version of the project (and many subsequent projects following in its footsteps) put an emphasis on stylized examples of the typeface in use. This often served to hide the flaws and limitations of the various typefaces.

In contrast, the new version of the site aims to provide a complete look at each typeface, cataloging all the available weights and styles, the kerning quality, OpenType features, special characters and more.

I have spent a great deal of time sorting through the growing number of open-source typefaces. I will highlight only those that show a high level of quality.

I plan on growing this site to be the definitive resource for open-source type. Please consider supporting the project via [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/ubuwaits).

## Changelog

### 2018 Oct 28
* **Add [BioRhyme Expanded](https://beautifulwebtype.com/biorhyme-expanded/)**

### 2018 Oct 25
* **Preload some fonts to improve rendering on page load**. It's going to be a constant challenge with page load times and font rendering, given the number of assets I'm loading. As a first step, I'm preloading fonts that appear in the site header and index page headers.

### 2018 Oct 23
* **Add [FiraGo](https://beautifulwebtype.com/firago/)**

### 2018 Oct 22
* **Add [Rakkas](https://beautifulwebtype.com/rakkas/)**

### 2018 Oct 19
* **Add [Archivo Black](https://beautifulwebtype.com/archivo-black/)**
* **Update the visual design of all typeface samples**. My original intention was to keep all the samples black and white in order to focus attention on the typeface rather than the design. However, I came to feel that the black backgrounds when viewed together became too monotonous. Additionally, the color helps to suggest a usage context for each typeface.
* **Remove Merriweather**. I could no longer ignore the feeling that Merriweather was not a top-quality open-source typeface. It's missing ligatures and other OpenType features and aesthetically I feel it has flaws.

### 2018 Oct 15
* Completely new version of site with new typefaces, updated examples, and new detail pages showing OpenType features and more.

## Suggesting Typefaces

I'm happy to receive suggestions for typefaces to feature either though [a GitHub issue](https://github.com/ubuwaits/beautiful-web-type/issues) or via [email](mailto:ubuwaits@gmail.com). When sending the suggestion please send an example or two of the type in use. This helps me to make an initial evaluation of the typeface.
